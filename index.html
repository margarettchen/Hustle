	  			<h1>Silent Disco on The Corner</h1>
	  			<p>Mary Gary (Hustle ’17) always had a passion for music and bringing people together. She observed the greatest limitation in Charlottesville was the noise complaints in residential areas that would cut the party short reliably around 2am. With the help of cutting edge technology, she brought her nonstop party vision to life in her Silent Disco party, hosted by HackCville itself! A couple hundred dollars worth of rented synced LED headphones, a turntable, and several pounds of flyers later, Mary pulled off the most quiet but lit party Elliewood had ever seen on a sublime April summer night, drawing over 80 attendees with requests for making this an annual event.</p>

	  			<p>Hung Tang (Hustle ’17) saw the success of BirchBox with bringing makeup to the masses monthly and saw an opportunity to bring this service to Charlottesville. He noted the anxiety and money that was poured into finals week stress-eating every semester and set to work analyzing his consumers’ needs. After assessing the top 10 snacks in demand during finals week, he put in an order for 50 cardboard boxes and several Costco bags worth of Sour Patch Kids and Cheez-its (among other snacks) and set to work pitching the products in libraries by day and packing by night.</p>

	  			<p>David Nguyen (Hustle ’17) joined Hustle with the vision of bringing his passion for wrestling and mixed martial arts to the masses. Several weeks and phone calls into the semester, he successfully designed and implemented biweekly mixed martial arts workshops in a borrowed gym space. He made a total of $415 in the first 3 classes, drawing a total of 24 people. He is pursuing this venture into the summer with plans to leverage his network in the mixed martial arts community to expand to various locations in Virginia, New Jersey, Colorado, and Chicago.</p>
